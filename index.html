<!--
  Use this template to define your projects, complete all parts to describe every aspects of your projects.

  For each part, add as many HTML elements as you need (paragraphs, images, grids, ....). 
  Your work on this document should be consequent since you have nearly 50 hours to do it (5 students * 10 hours).
  This document will serve as the reference for the next steps. 

  Use skeleton styles/classes. Skeleton has a number of small utility classes that act as easy-to-use helpers:
  - add class "u-full-width" to make element full width
  - add "u-max-full-width" to make sure elements don't run outside containers (great for images in columns)
  Add custom CSS in style.css only if needed / controlled
